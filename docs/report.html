            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
              Carbon awareness is becoming increasingly important in the modern world, and many
              companies are striving to be carbon-neutral in their operations. Existing research
              into carbon-aware computing has focused on high-power, high-performance computing
              systems, but there has not been any awareness into carbon-aware battery charging,
              especially for small-scale IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a controller
              framework for a battery-powered security camera that balances the tradeoff
              betweenaccuracy, latency, carbon footprint, and charging decisions based on a
              pre-defined reward function. This controller picks the optimal models and when to
              charge every task interval over a horizon of time.

            <h3 id="motivation-objective">1.1 Motivation & Objective</h3>
            <p>
              While significant research has addressed carbon-aware computing in data centers and
              high-performance systems, small-scale IoT devices remain overlooked. Battery-powered
              devices with flexible charging represent a massive, untapped opportunity for carbon
              optimization. If they are plugged in all the time, they can charge even when it is not
              carbon-efficient to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our objective is to develop an intelligent controller that optimizes both
              computational (which model to select) and charging decisions for battery-powered
              security cameras. With this approach, we can charge when it is more carbon-efficient,
              rather than always charging regardless of the carbon cost. We balance our model
              selection to account for this carbon-efficiency
            </p>
            <p>
              Because there are differences of opinion on how much each factor (accuracy, latency,
              carbon footprint, camera uptime) matters to an individual, we define a specific reward
              function that balances these factors. The system supports dynamic weights, so if the
              initial weights are not balanced to a specifc use-case, they are adjustable for other
              use-cases.
            </p>

            <p>
              For a full breakdown of how we restricted the optimization to solve this problem
              easier, see

            <h3 id="state-of-art-limitations">1.2 State of the Art & Its Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              Current carbon-aware research is focused around data-center energy considerations.
              Data centers incur large electricity costs and carbon emissions. There are 2 main
              works related to this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Carbon- and Precedence-Aware Scheduling for Data Processing Clusters<sup
                  id="cite-ref-2"
                  ><a href="#cite-note-2">[2]</a></sup
                >
                - This paper is focused on scheduling data center workloads such that time
                requirements are met, but we delay lower priority tasks to carbon-efficient times.
              </li>
              <li>
                Carbon-Aware Workload Management in Data Centers<sup id="cite-ref-3"
                  ><a href="#cite-note-3">[3]</a></sup
                >
                - This paper is focused on integrating energy components besides the grid, such as
                cooling, heating, solar panels, batteries, energy storage, heat pumps, and heating
                connections to maintain existing data-center workloads while minimizing carbon
                emissions.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Both of these papers focus on large scale systems with large scale workloads. These
              approachs are not directly applicable to small-scale IoT devices, which have very
              limited bandwitdh and very small battery capacity (energy storage).
            </p>

            <h3 id="novelty-rationale">1.3 Novelty & Rationale</h3>
            <p>
              Our approach relies on imitating an Oracle controller. This Oracle controller can see
              into the future and has full knowledge of the carbon timeseries before it occurs.
              Using that knowledge, we can solve the full discrete MDP based on the system state
              over a given finite horizon of time. We can then train a neural network to imitate
              this Oracle Controller, giving us a controller that can make decisions in real-time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, as carbon energy generally follows a sinusoidal pattern, we can leverage
              this neural network to also gain insight on the ebb and flow of carbon timeseries,
              further giving us more optimization potential.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, by modelling this problem as an MDP (and POMDP), we can take advantage of
              existing solving techniques (ex. Data-driven Planning via Imitation Learning<sup
                id="cite-ref-4"
                ><a href="#cite-note-4">[4]</a></sup
              >), which are well-studied and have multiple proven solutions.
            </p>

            <h3 id="potential-impact">1.4 Potential Impact</h3>
            <p>
              This system could easily be extended to other battery-powered devices that make
              decisions. Any system with a form of energy storage and energy input can take
              advantage of our models to create their own controllers that balance clean energy.
            </p>

            <h3 id="challenges">1.5 Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              Implementing an energy-aware decision-making controller for battery-powered edge
              devices presents several challenges. The primary difficulty is solving and generating
              sufficient training data from the Oracle MDP, as the state and action spaces grow
              quickly even under coarse discretization. Specific examples include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Deciding how static or dynamic the system should be to user-input. We can allow the
                user to dynamically adjust their requirements during runtime, but adjusting an
                already trained controller could be time-consuming, complex, or expensive,
                especially as we still have to maintain our task interval.
              </li>
              <li>
                Discretization of continuous variables. More precision means more runtime, but too
                much precision can make simple calculations more complex due to floating point
                errors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Carbon patterns vary from region to region. As such, we need to ensure as vast of
                variety carbon data as possible from different times of the year for a complete
                picture.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="metrics-success">1.6 Metrics of Success</h3>
            <p>
              We compare our trained Imitation (Custom) Controller to the Oracle controller over the
              following metrics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Accuracy - how many times over the horizon does the model selected meet the user's
                requirements?
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Success - number of times the selected model met the user's requirements, and had
                  enough energy to run.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Small Miss - number of times the selected model didn't meet the user's
                  requirements, and had enough energy to run.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Failure - number of times a model was unable to run, due to a lack of energy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Utility - differences in the rewards of the Oracle Controller (<a
                  href="#oracle-controller"
                  >Section 3.3</a
                >), the Imitation (Custom) Controller (<a href="#custom-controller">Section 3.4</a
                >), and Naive Controller (<a href="#naive-controller">Section 3.5</a>) decisions
                over each horizon.
              </li>
              <li>
                "Feasibility-Normalized Effective Uptime" - at each timestep \( t \), let \( F_t \)
                be the set of models feasible under the current energy constraint, and let \( a_t^*
                = \max_{m \in F_t} a(m) \) be the best achievable accuracy. If a model \( m_t \) is
                selected and runs, the timestep is scored as \( \frac{a(m_t)}{a_t^*} \); if no model
                is ran (Failure) it scores a \( 0 \). The metric is computed as the average score
                over the horizon.

            To simplify the optimization, we benchmarked and created model profiles separately
            before our simulation loop. The main simulation loop then uses these pre-computed
            profiles to make decisions at runtime.

            <h4>YOLOv10 Power and Latency Measurement</h4>
            <p>
              A Model task is defined as loading an image and running the default classifier
              function on it. The task involves:
            </p>

            <p>
              <a
                href="https://github.com/therealsamyak/ECM202A_2025Fall_Project_2/blob/main/model-profiler/power_profiler.py"
                target="_blank"
                >model-profiler/power_profiler.py:277</a
              >
            </p>
            <pre><code>start_time ← current_time()

FOR i ← 1 TO iterations DO
    avg_power ← measure_with_powermetrics(inference_task)
    append avg_power to inference_powers
    sleep for 4 seconds
END FOR

end_time ← current_time()
total_duration ← end_time - start_time

total_delay_time ← iterations x 4.0
actual_inference_duration ← total_duration - total_delay_time
avg_inference_time_seconds ← actual_inference_duration / iterations
</code></pre>

            <p>During this task, the power profiler measures:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Power consumption</strong>: Baseline, idle, and inference power in
                milliwatts using macOS
                <a href="https://ss64.com/mac/powermetrics.html" target="_blank">powermetrics</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Energy efficiency</strong>: Energy per inference in mWh calculated from
                power draw and inference time
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Performance metrics</strong>: Inference time, success rate, detection count
              </li>
              <li><strong>Model variants</strong>: All YOLOv10 versions (N, S, M, B, L, X)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The profiler uses <code>powermetrics</code> with sudo access to capture CPU/GPU/ANE
              power consumption during the model task, storing results in
              <a
                href="https://github.com/therealsamyak/ECM202A_2025Fall_Project_2/blob/main/model-profiler/power_profiles.json"
                target="_blank"
                >model-profiler/power_profiles.json</a
              >. Each model is benchmarked across 1000 iterations with outlier removal for stable
              baseline measurements. Time per inference is tracked to store latency information
              alongside power data. Outlier removal trims the top and bottom 20% of power readings
              to eliminate anomalies and uses median values for robust statistics.
            </p>

            <h4>YOLOv10 Accuracy</h4>
            <p>
              Model accuracy values are extracted from the COCO dataset benchmark results stored in
              <a
                href="https://github.com/therealsamyak/ECM202A_2025Fall_Project_2/blob/main/model-profiler/model-data.csv"
                target="_blank"
                >model-data.csv</a
              >. The dataset contains COCO mAP 50-95 scores for each YOLOv10 model variant, provided
              by
              <a href="https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/" target="_blank"
                >Ultralytics official documentation</a
              >.
            </p>

            <p>
              The accuracy analysis processes the CSV data to provide approximate accuracy values
              for each YOLOv10 model version, enabling the controller to make informed tradeoffs
              between detection accuracy and energy consumption. We normalize these values by
              performing \( \text{NormalizedAccuracy} = \frac{\text{COCOmAP5095}}{57.0} \) to get a
              value between \([0, 1]\) for all models.

            <h3 id="oracle-controller">3.3 Oracle Controller</h3>
            <p>
              The oracle controller has full knowledge of the future carbon trajectory
              \(\{d_t\}_{t=0}^{T-1}\) over the planning horizon.
            </p>

            <h4>State Space</h4>
            <p>
              \[ {s} = (t, B_t) \in \mathcal{S} = \{(t, B_t) \mid t \in \{0,\ldots,T-1\},\; B_t \in
              [0, B_{\max}]\} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              Where \(t\) denotes the current timestep index and \(B_t\) (mWh) denotes the current
              battery level.
            </p>
            <p>
              This state representation is minimal: it includes exactly the variables that affect
              future feasibility and decision-making. In particular, the oracle's knowledge of the
              carbon trajectory is encoded implicitly through the timestep index \(t\), as the dirty
              energy fraction \(d_t\) is a known exogenous function of time.
            </p>

            <h4>Action Space</h4>
            <p>
              \[ a_t = (m_t, c_t) \in \mathcal{A} = (\mathcal{M} \cup \{\varnothing\}) \times
              \{0,1\} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              Each action is \(a_t = (m_t, c_t)\), where \(m_t\) is the model selected for execution
              (or \(\varnothing\) if no model is executed), and \(c_t\) indicates whether the system
              charges during the current task interval.
            </p>

            <h4>Transition Probability</h4>
            <p>
              Given state \(s_t = (t, B_t)\) and action \(a_t = (m_t, c_t)\), the transition
              probability to successor state \(s_{t+1} = (t', B')\) is defined as:
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t, a_t) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } t' = t + 1, B_t + c_t \cdot
              r_{\text{chg}} \ge E(m_t), B' = \min\!\left(B_{\max},\, B_t + c_t \cdot r_{\text{chg}}
              - E(m_t)\right)\\[6pt] 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, all feasible actions induce a deterministic transition with probability one,
              while actions that would result in negative battery energy are assigned zero
              probability and are therefore infeasible.
            </p>

            <h4>Reward Function</h4>
            <p>
              At each timestep, the environment produces outcome indicators based on the chosen
              action:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                \( \text{success}_t = \mathbf{1}\{m_t \neq \varnothing \wedge \text{acc}(m_t) \ge
                u_{\text{acc}} \wedge \text{lat}(m_t) \le u_{\text{lat}}\} \)
              </li>
              <li>
                \( \text{small\_miss}_t = \mathbf{1}\{m_t \neq \varnothing \wedge (\text{acc}(m_t) <
                u_{\text{acc}} \vee \text{lat}(m_t) > u_{\text{lat}})\} \)
              </li>
              <li>\( \text{large\_miss}_t = \mathbf{1}\{m_t = \varnothing\} \)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The dirty energy incurred at timestep \(t\) is:</p>
            <p>\[ \Delta D_t = c_t \cdot r_{\text{chg}}\cdot \Delta \cdot d_t. \]</p>
            <p>
              Where \(c_t\) is the charge decision (0 or 1), \(r_{\text{chg}}\) is the charging
              rate, \(\Delta\) is the task interval, and \(d_t\) is the percent of energy that is
              dirty at that time.
            </p>
            <p>The immediate reward is defined as:</p>
            <p>
              \[ R(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) = W \cdot \text{success}_t - X \cdot \text{small\_miss}_t - Y
              \cdot \text{large\_miss}_t - Z \cdot \Delta D_t. \]
            </p>
            <p>
              The optimization objective is to maximize the <em>cumulative</em> reward over the
              planning horizon. As a result, the total contribution of successes, misses, and carbon
              cost depends only on their aggregate counts and total dirty energy consumed, not on
              the specific timesteps at which they occur. In particular, for fixed carbon intensity,
              a success followed by a miss yields the same cumulative reward as a miss followed by a
              success, and the timing of a success within the horizon does not affect its
              contribution as long as feasibility is maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cumulative quantities such as total successes, misses, or dirty energy consumed are
              <em>not</em> included in the state. These quantities are only used to compute the
              cumulative sum of per-step rewards and do not influence future system dynamics or
              feasibility. Because carbon cost is modeled as a soft penalty and does not constrain
              future actions, histories that reach the same state \((t,B_t)\) differ only by an
              additive constant in accumulated reward. Consequently, the optimal continuation from a
              given state depends solely on the remaining horizon and current battery level,
              preserving the Markov property without explicitly storing historical metrics in the
              state.
            </p>

            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>The oracle policy \(\pi^*\) maximizes the cumulative reward over the horizon:</p>
            <p>\[ \pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi} \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} R(s_t, \pi(s_t), s_{t+1}). \]</p>
            <p>This optimization is solved exactly using finite-horizon dynamic programming.</p>

                    for computational efficiency in dynamic programming, while maintaining
                    continuous battery values in state transitions.

                  <li>
                    The simulation uses a K-nearest neighbor approach with parameter \(K \in
                    \mathbb{N}_{odd}, K > 0\) to find the nearest discretized battery level with
                    feasible actions. The algorithm identifies the K closest battery levels and
                    selects the first one that has valid feasible actions. If fewer than K feasible
                    options are found within the initial search radius, the algorithm expands the
                    search radius incrementally until exactly K valid options are identified. This
                    ensures robust policy extraction while maintaining optimality within the
                    expanded search space.

            <p>
              The custom controller operates without access to the future carbon trajectory
              \(\{d_t\}_{t=0}^{T-1}\) available to the oracle (<a href="#oracle-controller"
                >Section 3.3</a
              >). At each timestep, it must make decisions based only on real-time observations. As
              a result, the control problem is naturally modeled as a Partially Observable Markov
              Decision Process (POMDP).
            </p>

            <h4>State Space, Action Space, Transition Probability, and Reward Function</h4>

            <p>
              The state space \(\mathcal{S}\), action space \(\mathcal{A} = (\mathcal{M} \cup
              \{\varnothing\}) \times \{0,1\}\), transition probability \(P(s_{t+1} \mid s_t,
              a_t)\), and reward function \(R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\) are defined exactly as in
              <a href="#oracle-controller">Section 3.3</a>. The custom controller operates in the
              same underlying MDP; only its observability differs.
            </p>

            <h4>Observation Space</h4>

            <p>At each timestep \(t\), the controller receives the observation:</p>

            <p>
              \[ o_t = (B_t, d_t, \Delta d_t) \in \mathcal{O} = [0, B_{\max}] \times [0,1] \times
              [-1,1], \]
            </p>

            <p>
              where \(B_t\) is the current battery level, \(d_t\) is the instantaneous dirty energy
              fraction, and \(\Delta d_t = d_t - d_{t-1}\) captures the change in carbon intensity
              since the previous timestep. The controller does not observe the timestep index \(t\)
              or any future carbon values \(\{d_{t'}\}_{t' > t}\).
            </p>

            <p>
              The inclusion of \(\Delta d_t\) provides a minimal trend signal, allowing the
              controller to infer short-term carbon dynamics using only locally available
              information. Unlike the oracle, which implicitly accesses the full trajectory through
              \(t\), the custom controller must reason about carbon evolution from this limited
              window.
            </p>

            <h4>Policy Learning via Imitation</h4>

            <p>
              Rather than attempting to solve the POMDP via belief-state planning, we learn the
              custom controller via imitation learning using the oracle policy \(\pi^*\) (<a
                href="#oracle-controller"
                >Section 3.3</a
              >) as an expert.
            </p>

            <b
              >To simplify this problem, we assume that ALL system parameters in
              <a href="#system-parameters">Section 3.2</a> are constant per controller. If any of
              these parameters change, the controller will need to be solved and retrained again.
              See <a href="#limitations">Section 5.3</a> for more information.</b
            >

            <h4 id="training-data-generation">Training Data Generation</h4>
            <p>
              To create training data for the custom controller, the oracle solver's optimal
              decisions must be translated into observation-action pairs that the imitation learning
              algorithm can learn from. This process extracts the oracle's state-action trajectories
              and converts them into the observation space that the custom controller will actually
              encounter at runtime.
            </p>

            <p>The training data generation process works as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>FOR each optimal trajectory τ FROM oracle solver DO
    observations ← []
    actions ← []
    
    FOR each timestep t IN τ DO

        // Extract carbon information
        carbon_intensity ← carbon_data[t]  // [0,1]
        carbon_change ← carbon_data[t] - carbon_data[t-1]  // [-1,1]
        
        // Normalize battery level for observation space
        normalized_battery ← state.battery_level / B_max  // [0,1]
        
        // Create observation vector (3D)
        observation ← [normalized_battery, carbon_intensity, carbon_change]
        
        // Encode action as discrete targets
        model_index ← index_of(action.model)  // 0-6 for YOLOv10 variants
        charge_decision ← int(action.charge)  // 0 or 1
        
        // Append to training dataset
        observations.append(observation)
        actions.append([model_index, charge_decision])
    END FOR
    
    // Save as compressed numpy arrays with metadata
    save_training_chunk(observations, actions, trajectory_metadata)

              Model selection uses cross-entropy loss, charging decision uses binary cross-entropy
              loss. Final loss combines both with equal weighting.
            </p>

            <p>
              The architecture consists of multiple hidden layers with ReLU activations, culminating
              in a dual-head output structure. One head produces logits for discrete model selection
              across available YOLOv10 variants, while the other head generates a continuous signal
              for the charging decision. This design enables the network to learn separate
              representations for model selection and energy management strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              We incorporate feasibility-aware inference design to ensure safety in critical
              applications. The network predictions are validated against system constraints before
              execution, with mechanisms to handle prediction failures gracefully.

            <h3 id="naive-controller">3.5 Naive Controller</h3>
            <p>
              We implement a naive baseline controller with a fixed, myopic policy that ignores
              carbon intensity and does not optimize over the horizon. The controller operates under
              the same system dynamics as defined in
              <a href="#system-parameters">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>Policy</h4>
            <p>
              At each timestep \(t\), the naive controller selects an action \(a_t = (m_t, c_t)\) as
              follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Select the lowest-energy model in \(\mathcal{M}\) that satisfies \((u_{\text{acc}},
                u_{\text{lat}})\). If sufficient battery energy is available, execute the model
                without charging.
              </li>
              <li>
                If insufficient battery energy is available to run that model, select the
                lowest-energy model in \(\mathcal{M}\) regardless of requirements and charge during
                the interval.
              </li>
              <li>
                If insufficient battery energy is available to execute any model, select no model
                and charge during the interval.

              operate outside those constraints. The simumlation loads the custom controller
              corresponding to the system parameters to ensure fair comparison across all
              controllers. See

              For each unseen test day, the simulation runs all three controllers simultaneously
              using the same carbon intensity trace and initial conditions. Each controller makes
              decisions at every task interval based on its available information: the oracle has
              full future carbon knowledge, the naive controller uses only current battery state,
              and the custom controller uses real-time observations.

              Performance metrics include total cumulative reward, success rates, charging patterns,

            <h3 id="limitations">5.3 Limitations</h3>

            <p>
              Due to computational and project time constraints, our simulation engine has the
              following limitations:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is no runtime measurement of battery consumption per task; we only use the
                model profiles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Idle energy consumed by any controller is not considered. In the real world, there
                is some very small idle energy cost even when the controller is 'sleeping.'
              </li>
              <li>
                Energy and latency consumed when running the controller-selection algorithm (or
                running the NN to make decision) is not accounted for.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A future simulation engine would consider all the limitations above.</p>

            <p>
              <b
                >As mentioned numerous times above, our custom controller is specifically trained on
                a set of system parameters. The custom controller does not support varying the
                system parameters without retraining the controller.</b
              >
              If we had more time to run the oracle on a wider range of system parameters, we would
              generate a massive dataset using our oracle that can train a controller to recognize
              the diverse requirements and parameter combinations that are possible. This would give
              us one general-use controller that is plug-and-play anywhere. Unfortunately, due to
              time constraints, we could only train a limited number of custom controllers with
              rigid parameters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Due to our time constraints, we were not able to perform more ablation studies on this
              controller. The computational cost of solving the MDP, even after the restrictions and
              trade-offs we made, there was not enough time to do this. There are so many system
              parameters that tuning a controller for every single combination, especially with the
              many tasks we were doing, is just not feasible. This ties in to the previous point, as
              more abelation studies would also allow for the general controller.
            </p>

            <h3 id="future_work">5.4 Future Work</h3>

            <p>
              Future work could incorporate algorithms and methodology from the Data-driven Planning
              via Imitation Learning paper<sup id="cite-ref-4"><a href="#cite-note-4">[4]</a></sup>
              to speed up our oracle training data generation. While our current approach uses basic
              supervised learning with cross-entropy loss, more sophisticated imitation learning
              techniques could improve controller performance and make the algorithms faster.
            </p>

            <p>
              If we wanted to be simplier, we could incorperate a dual-algorithm controller, where
              the main policy comes from the neural-network, but the fallback policy is the same as
              the Naive, to get the best of both worlds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, we could also explore an always-learning LSTM-type controller that
              self-updates itself every task interval at runtime. This would allow a
              'set-it-and-forget-it' autonomous controller that doesn't need to get retrained
              periodically.
