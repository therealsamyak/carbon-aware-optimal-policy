            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
              Carbon awareness is becoming increasingly important in the modern world, and many
              companies are striving to be carbon-neutral in their operations. Existing research
              into carbon-aware computing has focused on high-power, high-performance computing
              systems, but there has not been any awareness into carbon-aware battery charging,
              especially for small-scale IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a controller
              framework for a battery-powered security camera that balances the tradeoff
              betweenaccuracy, latency, carbon footprint, and charging decisions based on a
              pre-defined reward function. This controller picks the optimal models and when to
              charge every task interval over a horizon of time.

          <section id="introduction" class="section">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

            <h3>1.1 Motivation & Objective</h3>
            <p>
              As climate change accelerates, organizations face mounting pressure to reduce their
              carbon footprint across all operations. While significant research has addressed
              carbon-aware computing in data centers and high-performance systems, small-scale IoT
              devices remain overlooked. Battery-powered security cameras represent a massive,
              untapped opportunity for carbon optimization—they operate continuously, consume
              significant energy, and often charge during peak carbon intensity periods without
              awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our objective is to develop an intelligent controller that optimizes both
              computational and charging decisions for battery-powered security cameras. The system
              must balance competing priorities: maintaining security performance through
              appropriate model selection, ensuring low latency for real-time monitoring, minimizing
              carbon emissions through strategic charging timing, and preserving battery longevity.
              This requires a holistic approach that considers the entire operational lifecycle
              rather than optimizing individual components in isolation.
