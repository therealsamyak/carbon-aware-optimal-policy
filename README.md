## Optimal Charge Security Camera

An intelligent security camera system that dynamically selects YOLO models based on battery level and clean energy availability. Balances accuracy, efficiency, and sustainability through three controller approaches: Oracle (optimal), Custom (learned via imitation), and Naive (baseline).
